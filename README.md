<h1>I am learning C</h1>
<p>I am learning more C and this is just a calculator I made along the way</p>


<h1>How to Run!</h1>
<p>If you wanna run this for some reason......</p>
<p>Ensure you have the GCC installed, if you don't i mean idk what to say you probably shouldn't be looking at C projects but whatever assuming you do...
just run</p>

```sh
gcc -o calculator calculator.c
```
and then (for Linux/MacOS/Unix)
```sh
./calculator
```
or for windows
